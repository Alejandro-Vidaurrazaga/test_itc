Sonic the Hedgehog is a Japanese video game series and media 
franchise created and owned by Sega. The franchise follows Sonic, an 
anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who battles Doctor Eggman, a mad 
scientist. In addition to video games, Sonic incorporates printed 
media, animations, a 2020 feature film, and merchandise. The first 
Sonic game, released for the Sega Genesis on June 23, 1991, was 
developed after Sega requested a mascot character to compete with 
Nintendo's mascot Mario. Sonic's success helped Sega become one of 
the leading video game companies during the fourth generation of 
video game consoles in the early 1990s. When Sega exited the console 
market and shifted to third-party development in 2001, it continued 
the series on Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation systems. Sonic the 
Hedgehog is Sega's flagship franchise and one of the bestselling 
video game franchises, having sold more than 140 million copies by 
2016. Several Sonic games have been listed among the greatest of all 
time. dsfdsfsdfsdfsad
